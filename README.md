# Embroidefy
This is a Python script that launches a TKinter GUI. The GUI allows the user to put either a Spotify URI or share link into an input field. On clicking "CONVERT", a .svg file will be created at the level of the script containing "satin stitch" paths for Inkscape/Inkstitch. This file can then be converted to a .pes or any other machine embroidery file for use.

I'll add a requirements.txt file soon.
